# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a command-line application for managing a library's collection, allowing users to borrow and return books, and staff members to maintain the library's resources. The project is implemented in Python and uses JSON for data storage.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
library_system/
├── modules/
│   ├── book.py
│   ├── libraryuser.py
│   ├── librarystaff.py
